------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2025-05-17  | Translations not showing                          | Django i18n      | Created `locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`, ran `makemessages`, and edited translations.
2025-05-17  | Language switch form not returning to same page   | Django templates | Used `<input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ request.path }}">` in each form.
2025-05-17  | `.mo` file not generating                         | Django CLI       | Fixed `.po` header syntax errors and compiled translations with `compilemessages`.
2025-05-17  | `TemplateSyntaxError: static` in index.html       | Template logic   | Converted `index.html` into an extended template using `{% extends "base.html" %}` and `{% block content %}`.
2025-05-17  | Language flag buttons not switching text          | Middleware/HTML  | Verified `LocaleMiddleware` in `settings.py`, used `{% trans %}` blocks correctly, and restarted server.
2025-05-17  | Language switch not persisting between pages      | Session/Context  | Confirmed `LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME` in settings and `django_language` was set properly.
2025-05-17  | Page layout broken after refactor                 | Template layout  | Created `base.html`, moved common HTML structure (doctype, head, navbar, scripts) into it.
2025-05-18  | Contact page not using shared layout          | Templates / Layout | Replaced boilerplate HTML with `{% extends "base.html" %}` and `{% block content %}`.
2025-05-18  | Duplicate header and script tags in contact   | Template cleanup   | Removed all redundant `<head>`, `<header>`, and `<script>` tags already handled by `base.html`.
2025-05-18  | Contact page not translated yet                 | Django i18n        | Wrapped labels, placeholders, and titles in `{% trans %}` blocks and recompiled messages.
| 2025-05-18 | Duplicate msgid errors during `compilemessages` | Translations   | Identified repeated `msgid` entries in `django.po`. Removed duplicate definitions, retaining only one per unique string. Verified that Django uses the same translation across all templates. |
| 2025-05-18 | Needed to embed Google Maps with a custom pin logo       | Maps Integration | Switched from iframe to Google Maps JavaScript API to support custom markers. Enabled Maps API in Google Cloud Console. Created API key, restricted it to HTTP referrers, and prepared to use the business logo (`logofull.webp`) as a map pin at the studio address. |
| 2025-05-18 | Could not enter multiple domains for API key  | Google Cloud API  | Bypassed single-entry pop-up by editing API key via Cloud Console → Credentials tab. Added both `127.0.0.1:8000/*` and live domain with HTTP referrer restrictions. Locked API usage to Maps JavaScript only. |
| 2025-05-18 | Needed to keep Google Maps API key secure in Django      | Env Management    | Installed `python-decouple`, created `.env` file to store the API key, loaded it into `settings.py`, passed it via context to template, and updated the `<script>` tag to use `{{ google_maps_api_key }}`. Added `.env` to `.gitignore`. |
| 2025-05-18 | Google Maps API key not rendering in template          | Django View/Template | Realized `{{ google_maps_api_key }}` was empty. Traced it to the contact view not passing the context variable. Fixed by updating `views.py` to include the key in `render()`. |
| 2025-05-18 | `TemplateDoesNotExist` for contact.html                | Django Templates  | Template was expected in `main/contact.html` but was stored in `templates/contact.html`. Fixed by adjusting `views.py` to use the correct path. |
| 2025-05-18 | Google Maps loaded but showed “InvalidKey” error       | API Integration   | Page source showed `key=` was blank. Confirmed missing context variable. Fixed view logic to pass the key correctly.                 |
| 2025-05-18 | Custom marker logo not appearing like a pin            | UI/UX – Maps      | Uploaded circular logo and styled it as a custom marker. Created a pin-style version using a vector editor. Integrated into the map. |
